            <h2>Reasons for Taking This Course</h2>

            <p>Caddie/Crew Member</p>
			<p>I've been a caddie since I was 13 years old. My entire family caddied throughout their teen years and I followed in their same path. Caddying essentially involves being a golfers' personal assistant on the course. This includes carrying and keeping track of all golf equipment (clubs, balls, tees, markers). Additionally you will act as a guide, answering any and all questions about general golf instruction and course knowledge. Most importantly, making sure your golfer is enjoying his time at the course and generally feeling happy with his experience. I also work in the golf clubs' bag room, where I organize and store club members' personal golf equipment/clubs. </p>

            <h2>Hobbies and Special Interests</h2>
            <p>Reading non-fiction books, doing puzzles, rollerblading, strategy board games/video games are a few of the things I enjoy doing in my spare time. I spend a lot of time in the summer golfing due to how much the sport has grown on me and me being a caddie through my teen years. I used to play tennis in high school and I always enjoy playing with my brothers at the courts by our house. Recreational sports, such as, basketball, football, and baseball, where a big part of my childhood and I still find ways to participate with friends when I can. </p>
